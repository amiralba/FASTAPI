FastAPI Project

Welcome to my FastAPI project! This repository showcases my journey in learning Python and becoming a developer. It demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a web application using modern technologies and best practices.

Project Overview

This FastAPI application is a backend service that includes:

	•	User Management: User creation, retrieval, and management.
	•	Post Management: CRUD operations for posts.
	•	Voting System: Users can vote on posts and view vote counts.
	•	JWT Authentication: Secure endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.

Skills & Technologies

This project highlights a range of skills and technologies:

Python Programming

	•	FastAPI: Developed a RESTful API with FastAPI, leveraging its high performance and ease of use.
	•	SQLAlchemy: Used SQLAlchemy for ORM, managing database models and queries.
	•	Pydantic: Utilized Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

Web Development

	•	CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for users and posts.
	•	Authentication & Authorization: Integrated JWT for secure user authentication and access control.
	•	Testing: Wrote unit tests with Pytest to ensure code reliability and correctness.

Database Management

	•	PostgreSQL: Configured and used PostgreSQL for the application’s relational database needs.
	•	Alembic: Managed database migrations and schema changes.

Deployment & CI/CD

	•	Docker: Containerized the application for consistent environments using Docker.
	•	Nginx: Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
	•	GitHub Actions: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

Key Features

	•	Secure Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
	•	Efficient Data Management: Leveraged SQLAlchemy for effective database interactions.
	•	Robust Testing: Implemented comprehensive tests to validate functionality and reliability.
	•	Deployment Automation: Automated deployment processes with GitHub Actions and Docker.

Learning Highlights

	•	Modern Web Frameworks: Gained experience with FastAPI for building high-performance APIs.
	•	Database Integration: Mastered SQLAlchemy for ORM and PostgreSQL for database management.
	•	Security Practices: Implemented JWT authentication for secure API access.
	•	Containerization: Learned Docker for containerizing applications and Nginx for serving them.
	•	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

Project Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with the following components:

	•	API Endpoints: Defined using FastAPI, handling user and post operations.
	•	Database Models: Managed with SQLAlchemy ORM.
	•	Authentication: JWT tokens for secure access.
	•	Testing: Pytest for unit and integration tests.
	•	Deployment: Docker and Nginx for deployment and server management.

Future Improvements

	•	Enhanced Features: Plan to add more features such as notifications and user roles.
	•	Performance Optimization: Continuous improvement in application performance and scalability.
	•	Documentation: Expand documentation to include more detailed API usage and development guidelines.
